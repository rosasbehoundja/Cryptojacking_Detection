## IndabaX Benin Republic Hackathon 2024

Cryptojacking is a type of cyberattack that uses malicious scripts similar to those from large cryptocurrency houses to illegally mine cryptocurrency on other peopleâ€™s machines without their users being aware. These attacks are stealthy and difficult to detect or analyse, often leading to decreased computing speeds for users, as well as crashes due to the strain on computational resources.

**The objective of this challenge is to classify network activity from various websites as either cryptojacking or not, based on features related to both network-based and host-based data.**
